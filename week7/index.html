    <h1>Week 7 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a 
            function to an object that is provided as the first argument.
            Ex: function.call(argument)</li>
        <li>If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save 
            the result in a cache property. Then if the same argument is used 
            again later, we can return the value from the cache, rather than 
            having to compute the result again.</li>
        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that 
            are enclosed in parentheses and immediately followed by double 
            parentheses so they're invoked. They are useful for namespacing 
            variables and setting default values.</li>
        <li>Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will 
            ensure it's only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will 
            disappear. </li>
        <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of 
            the function, depending on certain conditions.</li>
        <li>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain 
            condition is met. It's a useful tool to use when iterative processes 
            are involved. A common example is a function that calculates the 
            factorial of a number</li>
        <li>Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of 
            the event loop. This means that a program can continue to run in a 
            single thread while waiting for another task to be completed.</li>
        <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple 
            asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism 
            for handling errors.</li>
        <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>
        <li>A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of 
            another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.</li>
        <li>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, 
            maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function.</li>
        <li>Calling a generator function doesn't actually run any of the code in the 
            function; it returns a Generator object that can be used to create an 
            iterator that implements a next() method that returns a value every time 
            the next() method is called.</li>
        <li>Generator functions employ the special yield keyword that is used to return a 
            value. The difference between the yield and the return keywords is that by 
            using yield, the state of the value returned is remembered the next time 
            yield is called.</li>
        <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be 
            applied as a series of functions.</li>
        <li>Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they 
            are called from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when 
            given the same arguments (referential transparency).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 13: Ajax</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with 
            a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.</li>
        <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
        <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
        <li>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>
        <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from 
            a request or to create your own response objects.</li>
        <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains 
            information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
        <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to 
            a request or response object.</li>
        <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
        <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I had never heard of Functional Programming before, is it not as much of an 
            industry standard as Object-Oriented Programming?</li>
    </ul>
