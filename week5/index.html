    <h2>Chapter 10 Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 types of errors: system, programmer, user.</li>
        <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>
        <li>An exception will also produce a stack trace. This 
            is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead 
            to the point where the error occurred.</li>
        <li>A warning can occur if there's an error in the code 
            that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. </li>
        <li> a ninja programmer should ensure that the code 
            they write fails loudly in development so any errors 
            can be identified and fixed quickly. But fail gracefully in production.</li>
        <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>
        <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error 
            objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any 
            code inside a finally block will run if an exception 
            does or does not occur.</li>
        <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing 
            tests that fail, then writing the code that passes 
            the test, then refactoring the code every time a new 
            feature is implemented.</li>
    </ul>
