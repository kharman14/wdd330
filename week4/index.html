    <h1>Week 4 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8 Forms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>const form = document.forms['search'];</li>
        <li>A form object also has a method called elements that returns 
            an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form. 
            In this case the form contains two controls: an input element 
            and a button element.</li>
        <li>const input = form.searchInput (both methods work, just be 
            careful if there are any naming clashes)</li>
        <li>A form can be submitted manually by the user employing a button 
            or input element with a type attribute of submit, or even an 
            input element with a type attribute of image.</li>
        <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back 
            to their initial values specified in the HTML. Reset buttons are 
            generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to 
            click and then wipe out all the data that's been entered. </li>
        <li>The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute 
            of a form, so it's sent to a different URL to be processed on 
            the server.</li>
        <li>We can actually stop the form from being submitted to that URL 
            altogether by using the preventDefault() method</li>
        <li>Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on 
            the server side. It is advisable to use both client-side and 
            server-side validation.</li>
        <li>We can improve the usability of the form further by giving instant 
            feedback, instead of waiting for the form to be submitted. This 
            can be achieved by adding the event listener directly to the input 
            field that will fire when the user presses a key 
            (using the keyup event).</li>
        <li>In a real application, you might end up having to validate many 
            different elements according to various different rules. If this 
            is the case, it would make sense to write some more generic 
            addError() and removeError() functions to deal with the different 
            types of validation you might want to apply to the various elements 
            in a form.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 12 Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism 
            and inheritance.</li>
        <li>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword 
            this refers to the object returned by the function.</li>
        <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables 
            using const and defining a function inside a constructor function. 
            These can be made public using getter and setter functions.</li>
        <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more 
            specific implementation.</li>
        <li>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which 
            can cause errors. This can be worked around by using that = this, 
            using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.</li>
        <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 15 Modern JavaScript Development</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods
             that make it easier to achieve common tasks.</li>
        <li>A library will abstract functionality into easier-to-use functions and methods.</li>
        <li>This shows how using a library can reduce the amount of code you 
            have to write, as well as making common tasks easier to implement.</li>
        <li>jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of 
            useful and well-tested functions.</li>
        <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and 
            methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.</li>
        <li>The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that 
            are responsible for different elements of an application.</li>
        <li>Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they 
            also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.</li>
        <li>React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components 
            and keep track of their state.</li>
        <li>Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the 
            code in order to reduce its file size.</li>
        <li>Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, 
            minified and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before 
            the closing /body tag to ensure that all elements on the page have 
            loaded before the script runs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there a best practice between using input submit versus a submit button in a form?</li>
    </ul>
