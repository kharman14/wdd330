    <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, 
            scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
        <li>We can manipulate an element's appearance using transform 
            functions. The value of the transform property is one or more 
            transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied 
            in the order they're provided. </li>
        <li>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, 
            up, or down. When you employ a translation function, you're 
            moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. 
            Transforms don't work on inline elements. </li>
        <li>Ex: The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, 
            and y from the top</li>
        <li>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, 
            you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. </li>
        <li>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors 
            horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it 
            will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking 
            your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original 
            aspect ratio. </li>
        <li>A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards 
            its center; in other words, the element's center will stay in the 
            same place as its dimensions change. </li>
        <li>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin 
            by a specified angle value. By default the point of origin is the 
            element's center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with 
            positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise.</li>
        <li>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</li>
        <li>Ex: transition: property, duration, timing-function, delay. transition: 
            transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</li>
        <li>A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any 
            smooth transition. With CSS transitions, we're essentially limited to 
            defining a first and a last keyframe. CSS animations allow us to add 
            any number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation in more 
            complex ways.</li>
        <li>Ex: @keyframes myAnimation { /* put animation keyframes here */ }</li>
        <li>There are two keyterms― from and to ―which evaluate to 0% and 100% 
            respectively. These values specify how far along the animation each 
            keyframe is located.</li>
        <li>This property is used to attach an animation (previously defined using 
            the @keyframes syntax) to an element: animation-name: myAnimation;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>With HTML5's Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.</li>
        <li>EX: {canvas} id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
            Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas.{canvas}</li>
        <li>Once we've stored our canvas element in a variable(in a JavaScript file canvas.js), 
            we then set up the canvas's context. The context is the place where your drawing is rendered.</li>
        <li>In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the 
            canvas is 200 pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is (200,200)</li>
        <li> It's an anonymous function. Anonymous functions are much like regular functions 
            except, as you might guess, they are without names.</li>
        <li>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you 
            to describe vector graphics using XML.</li>
        <li>A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap 
            images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality 
            even as you blow them up or shrink them down.</li>
        <li>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Like HTML, it's a markup metalanguage.</li>
        <li>Raphaël is an open-source JavaScript library that makes drawing and 
            animating with SVG much easier.</li>
        <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you'd like to be draggable.
            Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements. 
            Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you 
            want to have accept dropped items.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I understand the practicality of SVG and drag and drop, but when is an example of Canvas in use?</li>
    </ul>
