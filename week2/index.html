    <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>
    <h2>JavaScript Chapter 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript has a special operator called typeof for finding out the type of a value.</li>
        <li>You can even declare and assign multiple variables at the same time if you separate them with commas:
            let x = 3, y = 4, z = 5;</li>
        <li>If a number starts with a 0x, it is considered to be in hexadecimal (base 16) notation.</li>
        <li>ES6 now supports octal literals: If a number starts with a zero, followed by the letter o, 
            then it is considered to be in octal (base 8) notation</li>
        <li>ES6 also supports binary literals: If a number starts with a zero, followed by the letter b 
            then it is considered to be in binary (base 2) notation</li>
        <li>NaN is an error value that is short for "Not a Number". </li>
        <li>&& is and operator, || is or operator</li>
        <li>There is a soft inequality operator, != and a hard inequality operator, !==. 
            (similar to == and ===)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JavaScript Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, Loops</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the 
            items in the array, separated by commas.</li>
        <li>The slice() method creates a subarray; effectively chopping out a slice of an original 
            array, starting at one position and finishing at another. </li>
        <li>The splice() method removes items from an array then inserts new items in their place.</li>
        <li>A set is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot 
            include any duplicate values. They are similar in concept to a mathematical set, although 
            (for the time being at least) they don't contain mathematical set operations such as union, 
            intersection and product.</li>
        <li>Maps were another data structure introduced in the ES6 specification. They are a convenient 
            way of keeping a list of key and value pairs, and are similar to 'hashes', or 'hash tables' 
            or 'dictionaries' in other programming languages.</li>
        <li>A shorthand way of writing an if ... else statement is to use the ternary operator, ?, which 
            takes three operands in the following format:
            condition ? (//code to run if condition is true) : (//code to run if condition is false)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JavaScript Chapter 4: Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrow function example: const square = x => x*x;</li>
        <li>Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter's action of moving all variable and function declarations 
            to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined.</li>
        <li>The forEach() method. This will loop through the array and invoke a 
            callback function using each value as an argument. The callback function takes three parameters, 
            the first represents the value in the array, the second represents the current index and the third 
            represent the array that the callback is being called on. </li>
        <li>The map() method is very similar to the forEach() method. It also iterates over an array, and 
            takes a callback function as a parameter that is invoked on each item in the array.</li>
        <li>The filter() method returns a new array that only contains items from the original array that return 
            true when passed to the callback. </li>
