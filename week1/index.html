    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h2>LocalStorage</h2>
    <p>localStorage.setItem() to set item in localStorage. localStorage.getItem() to get 
        item from localStorage.</p>
    <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
    <p>Start with the smallest device and work up. Just because your website is responsive 
        doesn't mean that it's mobile first. Start small and scale up. Think about user 
        expereince, the less steps for the users the better. Think of how people are using 
        their devices. Keep network and loading times in mind: SVG/Webfonts are lower 
        bandwidth (aka load faster). Optimize and minify CSS and JS files. Moving the menu 
        to the bottom of the screen helped with reachability but also perceived speed.
        Mobile is still very new, so there might be better ways to do things than how 
        they're currently being done. Make it simply. Reduce cognitive load.</p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Does reducing white space in files, such as CSS and JS files worth it? 
            It minimizes file size but makes it less human readable.</li>
        <li>What does standard white space look like?</li>
        <li>What does GZIP a file mean? and when do you use it?</li>
        <li>How do you specify keyboard type for input?</li>
    </ul>
