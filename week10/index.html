    <h1>Week 10 Notes</h1>
    <h2>MDN: Validating Forms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all 
            required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This 
            is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted 
            matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls</li>
        <li>Built-in form validation uses HTML form validation features, which we've 
            discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally 
            doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better 
            performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</li>
        <li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely 
            customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</li>
        <li>Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects 
            a Regular Expression as its value.</li>
        <li>Always remember to help your users correct the data they provide. To that end, be sure to:
            Display explicit error messages, Be permissive about the input format,
            Point out exactly where the error occurs, especially on large forms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>MDN: Using Fetch</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status even if the 
            response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server responds with 
            headers, the Promise will resolve normally (with the ok property of the 
            response set to false if the response isn't in the range 200-299), and 
            it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the 
            request from completing.</li>
        <li>Basic fetch request: fetch('http://example.com/movies.json') .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => console.log(data));</li>
        <li>The Response object, in turn, does not directly contain the actual JSON 
            response body but is instead a representation of the entire HTTP response. 
            So, to extract the JSON body content from the Response object, we use the 
            json() method, which returns a second promise that resolves with the 
            result of parsing the response body text as JSON.</li>
        <li>As you have seen above, Response instances are returned when fetch() promises are resolved.</li>
